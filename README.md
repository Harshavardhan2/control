#This repository was generated by students in my Control Systems course.  There is no guarantee that all the solutions to various problems are correct, though the approach is likely to be correct in most cases. The objective of the course was to learn control systems in a hands on fashion.  In the process, students learnt how to generate Bode plots, Nyquist plots etc.. using Python.  

# manual: A compilation of the solutions of problems related to control systems from GATE exam papers over the years.  This provides a simple introduction to many topics in control systems.  In many cases, theoretical solutions are verified by numerical resuts and plots generated using Python.

# feedback:  This provides an introduction to control system implementation using feedback circuits.  Solutions to various exercises related to feedback circuits and oscillators, in the book titled Microelectronic Circuits, by Sedra and Smith are provided.  Many control system blocks were realised through opamps and RC circuits.  Wherever possible, Python and NGSPICE were used for simulating the output.
