PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING SPICE SIMULATONS

1) The file ee18btech11029_1.net is circuit netlist for feedback circuit which is for uncompensated system
2) Run the command ngspice ee18btech11029_1.net in the terminal of the folder
3) The following command creates ee18btech11029_1.dat file which is output voltage values with respect to time
4) Import the .dat file into spice_ee18btech11029_1.py and run the file.
5) Plot of step response verses time is observed

1) The file ee18btech11029_2.net is circuit netlist for feedback circuit which is for compensated system
2) Run the command ngspice ee18btech11029_2.net in the terminal of the folder
3) The following command creates ee18btech11029_2.dat file which is output voltage values with respect to time
4) Import the .dat file into spice_ee18btech11029_2.py and run the file.
5) Plot of step response verses time is observed
