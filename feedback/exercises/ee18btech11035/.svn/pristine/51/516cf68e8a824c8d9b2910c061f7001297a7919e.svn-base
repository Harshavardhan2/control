PROCEDURE FOR RUNNING SPICE SIMULATONS

1) The file "ee18btech11035_spice1.net" is netlist circuit for Open-loop System.
2) Run the command "ngspice ee18btech11035_spice1.net" in the terminal.This command generates a "ee18btech11035_spice1.dat"
3) The above command generates a "ee18btech11035_spice1.dat"
4) To get Open-loop Magnitude vs time Plot run "ee18btech11035_spice1.py"
5) Before running above python make sure .dat and .py are in same directory
6) The file "ee18btech11035_spice2.net" is netlist circuit for Closed-loop System.
7) Run the command "ngspice ee18btech11035_spice2.net" in the terminal.This command generates a "ee18btech11035_spice2.dat"
8) The above command generates a "ee18btech11035_spice2.dat"
9) To get Closed-loop Magnitude vs time Plot run "ee18btech11035_spice2.py"
10) Before running above python make sure .dat and .py are in same directory
