# Simulation of a Band pass filter using ngspice


There are two.net files present in this directory
## *buffer_fb.net* --> This is the simulation of the circuit connected with a buffer feedback.
This is simulated to get an idea that the initial system without compensation isn't stable.

## *rc_fb.net* --> This is the simulation of the circuit which has a RC low pass network as a negative feedback.
This is simulated so as to know how adding a pole in the dominant pole helps in compensating the system , making it stable.
